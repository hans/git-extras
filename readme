Git Extras
==========
Hey there! This is 'git-extras' - a little package of tools for git. They're nothing special - most of them just save you some typing and some time.

Installation
------------
It's pretty easy.. just a few steps.

1. Make sure all files are executable (if not, run `chmod +x git-*`).
2. Copy all files except this readme to `/usr/local/bin`, unless your Git executables are installed elsewhere.
3. Enjoy!
